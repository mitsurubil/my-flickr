## Why did I chose React.js

The app is suppose to consume the public Flickr API then display the results according to a basic wireframe in a list of images and informations about the photos. One of the prerequisite was that the website should fonction as a single page application.
I figured create react app will save development initialization time.
Due to its modular structure, React code is easy to maintain and is flexible. 
Moreover, React was designed to provide high performance rendering, it offers a virtual DOM program and server-side rendering, which make apps run faster.
React allows building high-quality, rich user interfaces through its declarative reusable components.
Those are some of the reason why I picked React.js. Efficiency, speed and reusability.
