## Why did I chose React.js

The app is suppose to consume the public Flickr API, then display the results according to a basic wireframe in a list of images and informations about the photos. One of the prerequisite was that the website should function as a single page application. <br>
I figured create react app will save development initialisation time. <br>
Due to its modular structure, React code is easy to maintain and is flexible. <br>
Moreover, React was designed to provide high performance rendering, it offers a virtual DOM program and server-side rendering, which make apps run faster. <br>
React allows building high-quality, rich user interfaces through its declarative reusable components. <br>
Those are some of the reason why I picked React.js. <br>
Efficiency, speed and reusability.
